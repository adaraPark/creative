            We Loved our photoshoot with Sandra! She was so much fun to work with and really knew how to get our young sound excited about
            taking photos Normally he wont stay still for more then two seconds but she did amazing! We love our family photos! definetely 
            going to hang these up in the front walk way!<hr><br>

            Sandra has done an amazing job photographing our growing family. It can be a bit crazy trying to get a toddler and dog to cooperate at 
            the same time, but somehow the pictures always come back perfect! She is great at listening to our vision for the photo shoot while making suggestions 
            and adjustments as needed during the session to get the best shot. We would recommend Sandra to anybody and plan to keep going back for more!<hr><br></p>

            Sandra is great!! I had photo session of my senior dog and the photos are beautiful to say the least.
            The session alone was a great experience; Sandra had so much patience and worked with us to find the right shots. My dog, 
            Eboni, is 15 and has always had her sassy moments but really was having a moment the day of the photo session. Despite Eboni's sassiness, 
            Sandra was able to capture Eboni perfectly and it was such a great experience. I would highly recommend Sandra to anyone interested 
            in getting professional photos of their pets. The photos and memories are something I will cherish forever.<hr><br></p>

            We just finished our photo shoot with Lynn for our 11 year wedding anniversary and the first time with family photos. It was wonderful.
            Sandra was so patient and kind with us, and made everything seem so easy and fun. We can't wait to see the final pictures!.<hr><br></p>

            Sandra is the absolute best photographer that I have ever worked with. Her portraits are magical. Not only does she have a kind and warm personality
            that makes you relax and enjoy your session, her patience to "get the shot" is what makes her work stand out above the rest.
            She takes her time and never makes you feel rushed. Sandra listens to what you are wanting and goes above and beyond to obtain it.<hr><br></p>
